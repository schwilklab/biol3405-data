## For one of the graphs, the x axis would be average LMA for each genus
## and the Y would be average turgor loss point for the four genusâ€™ that
## we have.

## Request from Zander 2024-12-04:

## correlation test:
wp_diff <- genus_means$mean_pd - genus_means$mean_md
cor.test(wp_diff, genus_means$mean_LMA)
